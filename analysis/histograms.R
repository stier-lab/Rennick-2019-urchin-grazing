# Here we will be creating histograms that explore the natural distribution of size and abundance of purple and red urhcins across (5????) LTER coastal sites in the Santa Barbara Channel. These realtionships will be used to create size bins for experimentaion and exemplify the natural distribution seen in our density focused herbivory trials. Becuase the abundance and distribution of herbivorous urchins will no doubt have an affect on kelp biomass, it is important to understand and map these distributions in these coastal sites where we will later be testing our experimental models. We will also be looking at our local density in realtionship to the transition density cited in Ling et al. 2015 that predicts the urhcin density required to incite a forward transition from a kelp dominated state to an urhcin dominated state.
