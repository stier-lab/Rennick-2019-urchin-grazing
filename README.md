## Abstract
The biomass of primary producers is ultimately determined by the rate at which they grow and how quickly they die or are eaten. In some instances, consumers disturb communities, dramatically reducing primary producer biomass and driving communities towards alternative ecosystem states. Yet the mechanisms behind consumer-driven disturbances remain unclear. Here, we tested how changes in the biomass and foraging habits of an important group of marine herbivores— sea urchins— triggers disturbance to a foundation species— giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera)— on temperate rocky reefs. Specifically, we demonstrated that urchin foraging rates increased linearly with urchin biomass in mesocosm foraging trials. We applied these results to 21 years of spatially explicit observational data on kelp community dynamics to test the long-standing hypothesis that deforestation of kelp communities occurs when the consumptive capacity of urchin populations exceeds the production of kelp detritus. We found a 50-fold reduction in giant kelp biomass when the consumptive capacity of sea urchins exceeded detrital production. Furthermore, the annual change in kelp biomass was dissociated from urchin biomass when detrital kelp was plentiful but as detrital supply became more limited, the annual change in kelp became increasingly negative. Our results suggest that the balance between detrital production and the consumptive capacity of sea urchins is critical to predicting when and where consumers are likely to force state transitions in kelp forest ecosystems.
